# Atypon_ML_Task
Implementation of a model for text classification. Using the imdb_review dataset. This dataset includes movie reviews. Each review is either labeled positive or negative. The dataset is already split into training and test set. The task is to classify the movie reviews of the test set into the two categories (positive/negative).

NOTE: please note that these were implemented on jupyter notebooks.
also note that I followed some tutorials and I used their implementations.
